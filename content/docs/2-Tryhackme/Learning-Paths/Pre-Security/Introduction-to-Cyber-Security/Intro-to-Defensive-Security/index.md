# Intro to Defensive Security

## Tasks
- Two main tasks:
  - Preventing intrusions from occurring
  - Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
- Some of tasks that are related to defensive security include:
  - User cyber security awareness: training users about cyber security helps protect against various attacks that target their systems
  - Documenting and managing assets: we need to know the types of systems and devices that we have to manage and protect properly
  - Updating and patching systems: ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness)
  - Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention system (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack
  - Setting up logging and monitoring devices: without proper logging and monitoring of the network, it won't be possible to detect malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appear on our network, we should be able to know
- Cover:
  - Security Operations Center (SOC)
  - Threat Intelligence
  - Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
  - Malware Analysis

## Security Operations Center (SOC)
- A SOC is a team that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are
  - Vulnerabilities: fix it by installing a proper update or patch. If a fix is not available, the necessary measures should be taken to prevent an attacker from exploiting it. Although remediating vulnerabilities is of vital interest to a SOC, it is not necessarily assigned to them
  - Policy violations: 
  - Unauthorized activity: A SOC need to detect such an event and block it as soon as possible before further damage is done
  - Network intrusions: Detect and prevent as soon as possible
- Security operations cover various tasks to ensure protection; one such task is threat intelligence

## Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
- Digital Forensics
- Incident Response
- Malware Analysis

## Example
- Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. A SIEM gathers security-related information and events from various sources and presents them via one system. Examples:
  - failed login attempt or login attempt from an unexpected geographic location
  - With machine learning, a SIEM might detect unusual behavior such as a user logging in at 3 AM when he usually logs in only during work hours
